# Zomato Dataset Exploration and Analysis
## Project Overview
In this project, I focused on cleaning and exploring a dataset from Zomato to gain insights into online orders, restaurant types, and correlations between ratings and prices. The dataset consisted of various restaurant entries, including details such as restaurant name, online ordering availability, ratings, and cuisine type.
