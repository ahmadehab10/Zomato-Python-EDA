# Zomato Dataset Exploration and Analysis
## Project Overview
In this project, I focused on cleaning and exploring a dataset from Zomato to gain insights into online orders, restaurant types, and correlations between ratings and prices. The dataset consisted of various restaurant entries, including details such as restaurant name, online ordering availability, ratings, and cuisine type.

## Key Insights
### Online Ordering Trends:

Analyzed which types of orders were predominantly online versus those that were not.
Identified trends in online ordering behavior across different restaurant types.

### Restaurant Types:

Explored the distribution of various restaurant types and their popularity in the dataset.
Investigated how the type of cuisine impacted online order preferences.

### Correlation Analysis:

Examined the correlation between ratings and prices to understand pricing strategies relative to customer satisfaction.
Identified patterns showing which restaurants received the most ratings and how that related to their online order options.

### Top Rated Restaurants:

Compiled a list of restaurants with the highest ratings and analyzed factors contributing to their success.
